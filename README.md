# Welcome to a beginner friendly DTU HPC guide! 


DTU HPC is DTUs computing cluster service, offering state of the art computing solution for developing computationally advanced algorithms. It is a more versatile alternative to services such as Google colab, as it allows to run experiments without connection and with control over the hardware used. This note is a hands-on tutorial on getting started on DTUs HPC system, and is, in most part, to be considered a practical extension of [DTU HPCs own material](https://www.hpc.dtu.dk/) for user's with little to no prior experience using cluster services or linux. We aditionally provide a GitHub repository which aids in establishing project structure and code debugging.
